          <strong>Description:</strong>
          What would the world be like if 80 percent of the population
          manifested extraordinary superpowers called “Quirks” at age four?
          Heroes and villains would be battling it out everywhere! Becoming a
          hero would mean learning to use your power, but where would you go to
          study? U.A. High's Hero Program of course! But what would you do if
          you were one of the 20 percent who were born Quirkless? Middle school
          student Izuku Midoriya wants to be a hero more than anything, but he
          hasn't got an ounce of power in him. With no chance of ever getting
          into the prestigious U.A. High School for budding heroes, his life is
          looking more and more like a dead end. Then an encounter with All
          Might, the greatest hero of them all gives him a chance to change his
          destiny…
